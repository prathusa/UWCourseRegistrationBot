# UWCourseRegistrationBot

Tired of hoping and praying to enroll into high demand classes that are closed? 
This course enrollment bot will relentlessly attempt to enroll in all classes in your cart and waitlist.
You no longer have to keep refreshing the course enroll app to see if any sections open up.


# Set up course enroll

Make sure all of the classes in your cart and waitlist have a section selected.
Remove any classes you do not want to enroll in from your cart.
The bot will attempt to enroll you into all classes in your cart and waitlist.

# How to use the bot

First you need to unzip the dist.zip file found in releases:
https://github.com/prathusa/UWCourseRegistrationBot/releases/download/1.0/dist.zip

And then edit the account.json file with your Wisconsin username and password.

Finally, you need to run the uwCourseSniper.exe file.

That's it!
